	Abstract = {Teaching and learning computer programming presents teachers and students respectively with many challenges, especially when taught with the ``traditional'' approach. Several alternative teaching approaches were proposed the previous years, but they seem not to fulfil successfully the needs of the twenty-first century students. Students nowadays are raised in a digital world and they learn and react differently. Students start to use computers before they first attend formal education, while computer games have become a part of their everyday life. A growing number of teachers/researchers propose the incorporation of educational games (or serious games) in the teaching of computer programming with the aim of reinforcing instinctive motivation through challenging students, piquing their curiosity and providing them with a sense of control and imagination. This paper aims to review the functionalities that should be supported by educational games in general and the extent to which these functionalities are supported by educational games for computer programming. The comparative analysis of several educational games for programming demonstrates that the majority of games seem well established, but they teach fairly simple concepts and their actual trials and validations are limited. The paper also discusses the implications of our work for the development of educational games that can fully support the identified features and teach complex programming elements.},

	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This work investigates the use of programming games as a way to establish the high school students first contacts with programming concepts. Programming games are puzzle style games in which the player must solve problems that require algorithmic logic using some programming notation. OBJECTIVE: The research sought to evaluate which characteristics of the programming games are perceived positively by the students. METHOD: The research was carried out with 14 students who used three different programming games (Code Combat, NoBug's Snack Bar and Lighbot). They answered a questionnaire with open and closed questions about (i) preferred game, (ii) Engagement and fun, (iii) tutorial style (way of proposing problems to players); And (iv) perception about programming concepts involved. RESULTS: The Code Combat and LightBot games tied the students' preference, with Lightbot achieving a better engagement and fun score. The Tutorial style of Code Combat and NoBug's Snack Bar received the best scores. The students reported having understood the concepts of function (92.9\%), Loop (92.9\%) and variable (71.2\%) after using the games and their perception of the difficulty of programming was easy or average (71.4\%). CONCLUSION: The use of programming games in students' initial contacts can bring beneficial results by creating a less intimidating environment in which the student perceives himself capable of achieving his goals while having fun. It aids to avoid obstacles that the perception of the difficulty of programming could generate. Concepts such as loops and functions were better assimilated by students than the concept of a variable, suggesting the need to rethink the traditional organization of textbooks and introductory programming courses.},

	Abstract = {Specially designed programming environments have been used for decades to support the novice programmers learning programming. In this paper, we present various forms of Educational Technology that have guided the design of educational programming environments the last two decades. The design and aspirations of three distinct programming environments developed at the University of Macedonia are presented. These include a Programming Microworld, an Educational Game and a Distributed Pair Programming system. The potential benefits of the different features of the three environments are presented along with results from their evaluation. Conclusions are drawn regarding the technologies incorporated in these different programming environments. Specifically, emphasis is given on technologies and features that seem to be important for motivating and engaging students in learning programming and should be taken into account by researchers designing new educational programming environments.},

	Abstract = {The educational landscape continues to transform significantly in a way that it engages students' interest and improves learning processes. Such an example is the gradual use of educational games, which seem to be an exceptional means to motivate and engage students in ways that will make learning more challenging and interesting for them. However, although educational games are a very interesting tool that could be used in education, an interesting challenge that should be addressed is the identification of all the ways students' progress and results can be measured for examination. This way, there is a high demand for accountability regarding the measurement and analysis of enriched game based learning activities or game-based learning analytics (GBLA). This demand is especially highlighted in one of the most difficult areas of Computer Science, which is computer programming education. In this paper, we are proposing a framework that will guide the incorporation of learning analytics mechanisms in computer programming education. We demonstrate this process through the implementation of the framework in an educational Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game we have developed for the domain.},
